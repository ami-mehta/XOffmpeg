    "# Creating animations with Flat and ffmpeg\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to produce animations with [Flat](https://xxyxyz.org/flat), [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). The notebook builds on examples from [Material of Language](https://github.com/aparrish/material-of-language/), and in particular assumes that you're familiar with the material in this [interactive widgets tutorial](interactive-widgets.ipynb). In the notebook, I show two techniques for generating animations:\n",

    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we'll define an \"animation\" as a series of images (or \"frames\") that are shown in succession quickly enough that they can produce the illusion of motion (taking advantage of [beta movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_movement)). Our strategy for producing an animation in Python is to write a function that takes an integer parameter that indicates the current frame index, and return an image for the corresponding frame. This is close to the way that (e.g.) the `draw()` function in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) works, except there is no canvas that persists between frames, and you have to call the function yourself for each of the frames you want to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary strategy for generating an animation in this notebook is writing a function like this and then calling it in a loop. But a super easy way to experiment with animation is [ipywidget's `Play` control](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html#Play-(Animation)-widget). This widget produces a sequence of increasing integers after you press a \"Play\" button, which you can connect to a function with `widgets.interact()`.

There is no way to export a video file directly using the `Play` widget, but you could use [licecap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to capture a GIF right from the screen, or do a screen recording with (e.g.) QuickTime Player. The primary disadvantage is that you can't control the actual frame rate: the `Play` widget attempts to update every `interval` milliseconds, but may not actually succeed in drawing that frequently (if, for example, your computer isn't fast enough to render your scene that quickly). You're also limited to generating images whose resolution is less than the size of your browser window.\n",

This is a standard workflow, and is supported by a number of video editing tools. In order to keep things programmatic, open source and cross-platform, we'll be using the excellent [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), a command line tool for editing video files.\n",

A hundred milliseconds doesn't sound like much, but when you're rendering thousands of frames, it can easily add up.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, I recommend using [CairoSVG](https://cairosvg.org/) to render Flat-produced SVG code as PNG images. In my initial round of benchmarking, CairoSVG renders Flat page objects to PNG 30x-50x faster than Flat's built-in code."

    "* You *need* to draw a background for the video to work! Flat pages have a transparent background by default, and the encoded video will show transparent backgrounds as all black. If you want the letters in this example to show up, you need to draw a white background on every frame.\n",
    "* If you're using a random number generator, either seed the generator with the same seed on every frame (as discussed in the [interactive widgets notebook](interactive-widgets.ipynb)) or use a random number generation technique (like [simplex noise](https://github.com/lmas/opensimplex) that allows you to ask for random numbers at particular seed values.\n",
    "* In the example below, the `end_frame` variable specifies how many frames the animation should last; the `fraction` variable inside the function calculates a value from 0 to 1 that indicates how much of the animation has passed given a particular `step` value. This is then used as a multiplier on the random values added to the `x` and `y` coordinates of each glyph. (Subtracting this value from 1, as I did below, essentially \"reverses\" the animation, moving the characters back into position instead of moving them progressively further away.)"
